# Write a program to check if the given number is a palindrome number.
#
# A palindrome number is a number that is same after reverse. For example 545, is the palindrome numbers

# Expected Output:
#
# original number 121
# Yes. given number is palindrome number
#
# original number 125
# No. given number is not palindrome number
# Considering number as string

if s == output:
    print(output, "is palindrome.")
else:
    print(output, "is not a palindrome number.")

# considering number as integer.
